An AI-powered, RAG-based Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) management system built for enterprises. Developed for Innovatiview and licensed to multiple enterprise clients, each with a customized document hierarchy.

---

## Overview

The Innovatiview SOP Portal centralises SOP documents in a searchable, role-restricted web application. Employees can query SOPs in natural language through an AI chat interface powered by a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Administrators manage documents, users, and permissions through a dedicated dashboard.

The system is architected to support multiple enterprise configurations — the document hierarchy (e.g., Department/Sub-department/Document or Client/Project/Document) is tenant-configurable at the deployment level.

## Core AI Concept — RAG Pipeline

1. SOP PDFs are parsed, chunked, and embedded via Ollama into ChromaDB
2. When a user submits a question, semantic search retrieves the top-k relevant chunks
3. The LLM generates an answer strictly grounded in the retrieved SOP context — no hallucination outside the document corpus

---

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Three roles are enforced across the system:

- **Employee** — OTP-based email login, read-only SOP access, AI chat
- **Admin** — Password login, manages documents, categories, and users within their scope
- **Superadmin** — Full control over users, domains, permissions, and system configuration

---

## Database Schema

10 relational tables covering: users, roles, departments/categories, documents, document chunks, vector metadata, OTP tokens, audit logs, permissions, and tenant configuration.

## Architecture

```
User Query
    |
    v
Flask API
    |
    +---> ChromaDB (semantic search) ---> top-k chunks
    |
    +---> Ollama LLM (mistral) ---> answer grounded in SOP context
    |
    v
Response to User

PDF Upload
    |
    v
PyMuPDF (parse + chunk)
    |
    v
Ollama Embeddings (qwen3-embedding:0.6b)
    |
    v
ChromaDB (store vectors) + AWS S3 (store original PDF)
```

## Security

- OTP email authentication for employees (no stored passwords)
- Bcrypt password hashing for admin accounts
- Role and domain-scoped document access
- HTTPS-enforced in production
- AWS S3 pre-signed URLs for secure document delivery

---

## PWA Support

The application is installable as a Progressive Web App on desktop and mobile via a Service Worker and `manifest.json`, enabling offline-capable document browsing.

---

## Enterprise Deployments

The portal has been deployed or is in procurement for multiple enterprises, each with a custom document hierarchy:

| Client         | Document Hierarchy                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Innovatiview   | Department / Sub-department / Document      |
| Abiz Corp      | Client / Project / Document                 |
| Emaar          | Custom hierarchy (enterprise configuration) |
